<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once the user has created an account or logged in, they will be redirected to out main dashboard. This page will display all of our datatype, problems, and a favorites section to the right.

*The user has added favorite problems and now has a list.*

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot2]](https://example.com)

The user will be able to select a datatype and only will the specific datatype selected be shown, as well as being able to search by difficulty pertaining to the datatype.


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot3]](https://example.com)


Once the user clicks on the problem name, they will be brought to the Algo page, this is where the user can view the problem, solution, and even say they solved the problem by clicking the button under the problem name on the top left.

Once clicked it will change to "remove from solved"

*These solved problems will display a checkmark on the status section of the table and will follow the user throughout the site.*


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot4]](https://example.com)



[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot5]](https://example.com)


Going back to the algo page, a user can leave comments pertaining to that specific algorithom. They can leave a normal comment as well as a special feature of leaving an optional code that they've used to solve that problem.

*The language it accepts is javascript, we are looking to improve the site so it can accept other languages as well.*


[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot6]](https://example.com)



Once the user has submitted their comment, it will appear under the comment section in recent order. The user who created the comment is allowed to delete it.
